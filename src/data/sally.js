        maelezo: "The Endoro Waterfalls is a fascinating place to be. This beautiful site is situated on the Southern border of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, facing the Karatu Town. The pathway that leads to Endoro waterfall goes through the forest and the Elephant Caves. It takes approximately 2-3 hours of a moderate hike to explore the beauty of this completely untouched forest. Basically, the Endoro entrance gate, which is approximately 6.5 kilometers away from Karatu town, is an ideal access to the waterfalls.The Endoro River, which flows all year round from the crater rim, is fed by natural water springs in the Crater highlands and cascades over 40 meters from the top to the bottom. The trail through a dense rainforest down the narrow stairway to the waterfall provides good physical exercise and is a perfect way to stretch after several hours of sitting in the car or after bedtime.The pathway to this waterfall provides a spectacular perspective of the Karatu town and the southern end of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area highlands. The same route is recommended for bird lovers and those interested in huge wild game like elephants, buffaloes, and bush pigs.",
        zaid: "Endorro Elephant caves Endoro Elephant Caves are a few minutes’ walk from Endoro Waterfall. Over the course of many years, elephants dug into the hills to acquire soil rich in minerals essential for their body. The caves were named (the elephant caves) after the elephants who created them by digging through dense rock using their massive tusks to consume fresh soil rich in vital nutritional properties. The soil was formed many years ago from volcanic emissions mixed with the organic component of soil, which was formed by the decomposition of leaves and other organic material by soil micro-organisms. However, apart from elephants, other animals such as buffaloes, waterbucks, and bushbucks visit the caves to obtain these necessary minerals. These caves are accessible on foot as part of a long hike to nearby waterfalls.",

        maelezo: "It was here that Mary and Louis Leakey, over the course of more than 30 years of backbreaking work, unearthed the first well-dated fossils and artefacts of some of our earliest human ancestors. Their discoveries include the famous Zinjanthropus (Australopithecus boisei) skull, as well as remains of  Homo habilis, the presumed maker of the numerous early stone tools found in deposits ranging in age from 1.6 to 1.8  million years ago, and Homo erectus, the larger- bodied and larger- brained hominin that preceded the earliest modern humans (Homo sapiens).The gorge may be visited year-round. It is necessary to have an oﬃcial guide to visit the actual excavations.",

        zaid: "The Olmoti Crater is named after the Maasai word, ‘Olmoti,’ meaning a big cooking pot due to its shape. Unlike the Ngorongoro Crater, Olmoti Crater is a shallow sunken caldera covered with grass and bisected by a river valley which provides a reliable water supply and suitable grazing pastures for wild animals throughout the year.Its great vantage point offers a spectacular view of the environs, blended with grazing animals such as antelopes and elands. A beautiful view combined with protruding rocks strewn around the highest point and the end of the trails. A spectacular view of Munge Waterfall from the famous Munge River, which drains into the Ngorongoro Crater, can be seen from the viewpoint. A pleasant stroll through the forest leads up to the crater rim before descending to the crater floor at Olmoti. The crater is covered by water streams, varieties of plants and wild species.",

It is one of the best places in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area to spot predators and enjoy the stunning landscapes. Standing here means you're in the midst of a calving ground for migratory wild animals, specifically the wildebeest migration. It is typically composed of vast swaths of short grassland, soda-lake Masek, marshes, and woodland vegetation that support both residents and migratory animals.",
        zaid:"The Best of Ndutu Plains While Ndutu is an excellent game viewing area throughout the year, the best time to visit the Ndutu plains is from the end of December, when the Great Migration herds begin to arrive from the north, until April, when millions of wildebeest, gazelles, and zebras begin their journey northwards again. Due to the seasonal rains, massive herds of wildebeest and zebra can be seen all over these plains at this time of year. Thousands of calves are born within Ndutu during the calving season, making Ndutu a home for new creatures on Earth. Giraffe, impala, elephant, dik dik, lion, cheetah, leopard, hyena, bat-eared fox, genet, jackal, wildcat, and many other animals end up living in Ndutu. The plains, marshes, and lakes to woodland attract an abundance of bird species.",

It is located on the southern edge of the Serengeti Plains within the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and far north of Lake Eyasi. The site contains a long series of Plio-Pleistocene, predominantly volcano-sedimentary deposits rich in archaeological and paleontological remains, which are overlain by Precambrian metamorphic rocks.",
        zaid: "The paleoanthropological relevance of the entire area has been recognized since the mid-1930s, although Laetoli became known in the 1970s as a result of exciting discoveries such as the Holotype and other remains. It has exceptional evidence of the earliest bipedal hominid traces, which date back 3.6 million years. About 3.6 million years ago in Laetoli, two early ancestors of humans walked through wet volcanic ash. When the nearby volcano erupted again, subsequent ash layers covered and preserved the oldest footprints of early humans.Today, the Laetoli footprints are the oldest known footprints of early ancestors of humans in the world. The Laetoli Footprints, according to archaeologists, exhibit three distinct tracks of an upright walking hominid known as Australopithecus afarensis. The entire footprint trail is almost 27 meters long and comprises approximately 70 early human footprint impressions. The Olduvai Museum has replicas of these footprints.Kohl Larsen, a German entomologist, first studied the Laetoli area in the 1920s, yielding a few fossils. The hominid footprints were discovered in 1974 by a team led by Mary Leakey, and excavations were conducted in 1978 and 1979.  The site is open to researchers interested in human origins and cultural development. Every year, researchers from local and foreign universities visit the site to work on various geological bed exposures that make up more than fifty sites.",

You can take a nature walk from the crater rim or descend to the crater floor to explore various available attractions.The Empakaai elevation is approximately 3,200m above sea level on the western side and 2,590m above sea level on the eastern side. It is always shrouded in mist due to its high altitude, and the lake appears emerald or deep blue.Empakaai crater is popular for walking safaris, wherein tourists hike for about one hour and walk back for about two and a half hours, depending on personal fitness. Visitors can explore the lake and the dense rainforest inside and around it near the floor.part of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, the Empakaai crater shares a substantial percentage of wildlife, providing a higher possibility to spot some of the Big Five, particularly leopards, lions, elephants and buffaloes. It also hosts smaller wild animals such as Monkeys and various bird species. In an ideal coincidence, a long walking safari done in the NCA through Oldoinyo Lengai and Lake Natron situated outside the area that can last for two to four days can be enhanced by including safaris to Empakaai Crater. This crater can be visited at any time of year, with a greater emphasis from June to December (drier seasons). A walk to Empakaai crater needs to be accompanied by an armed ranger. There is a special campsite on the crater rim for camping. However, booking in advance is highly recommended.",
